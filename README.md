## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 3
- ES 6
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- Responsive web design
- CSS Flexbox
- ES 6 Syntax
- Looping in JS
- Arrow function JS
- Some JS event listener

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("Hello WorldðŸ‘¾");
};
```

### Continued development

Maybe in the future I will change some designs in this project and add some other interesting features.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flex](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This really helped me to create responsive and attractive web layouts.
- [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) - This is an amazing web which helped me finally understand JavaScript. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this programming language.
